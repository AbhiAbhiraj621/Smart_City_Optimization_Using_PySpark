# Smart_City_Optimization_Using_PySpark

A PySpark-based analytics project to optimize electricity usage across smart city zones using real-time IoT-style data.

## Project Goals
- Detect peak electricity usage across zones
- Identify inefficient zones
- Study temperature impact on power usage

## Dataset
Synthetic dataset with 7,200 records
- Fields:
  - 'zone_id'
  - 'timestamp'
  - 'consumption_kwh'
  - 'temperature_c'
  - 'humidity_percent'

## Sample Analysis Questions
- When is peak usage for each zone?
- Which zones are inefficient?
- How does temperature affect usage?
